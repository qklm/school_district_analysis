# Overview of the school district analysis:
Looking at a large data set of students, grades, and schools to summarize into an easy to read clear data frame wherein more specific questions can be asked.

# Results:
 * Charter schools have the highest overall passing rate. Despite lower student spend, and substantially lower school budget
 * District schools perform at a drastically worse rate, some flirting with a 50% passing rate for 2 core classes.
 
# Summary:
The supremacy of the Charter schools in this narrow scope is likely due to a few key factors in the operation of a Charter School. They do not typically have a special needs program. They choose their students (largely by testing). Charter schools also typically have substantially smaller class sizes. These 3 factors should add a subliminal asterisk to the amalgamated P/F results. Students of charter schools are often from wealthier families or at the very least in wealthier areas, thus out of school tutoring is a more viable addition for students that are struggling.
